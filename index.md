# Course preparation resources. 

Please set up your computer for R, before you start your G/MPH (we are happy to help with any problems you have in doing this once your course starts). If you have little Statistical knowledge, or are rusty, you may benefit from additionally engaging with some Statistical material as preparation. We teach from the absolute basics, at a fast pace.

## Value of preparation prior to your MPH <a name="general_advice"></a>

The term 1 modules will give you a solid foundation in epidemiology and statistics and in coding with R. You will also learn key principles in research methods and of public health practice. One of the strengths of our MPH is the strength of our Statistics module, where you learn Statistical concepts and to perform analysis using R software. This is also a challenge, since it is fast-paced. Our students have a diverse range of backgrounds, and there will always be some students with little or no experience of Statistics. Many of our students have never written a line of code in any software language. The modules start with the basics and, if you work hard, you will be on a steep learning curve and will reach a high level of understanding by the end of term 1.

With that said, you have the opportunity to lower the gradient of your learning curve by doing some preparatory study ahead of the course, in Statistics and in R coding in particular. This page aims to give you some pointers on how to spend that pre-course preparation time.

Before you come, **we ask you to install R/ Rstudio onto your computers**, and check that you can run a couple of commands. We also recommend that you take some time to learn some Statistics, especially if you do not know or remember what p-values or confidence intervals.

## Essential: Setting up your computer for R <a name="cpu_setup"></a>

You are required to **install R and R studio** before you start your G/MPH. Here's what you need to do. You will be using R for your Statistics module, and some of you will also use it for your dissertations. (see [https://www.r-project.org/about.html](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)).

**The following are written directions for installing R and R studio. If you prefer to watch online videos for this purpose, then note that the following guides you through this process: [Free R Tutorial - R Basics - R Programming Language Introduction](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)** (no need to pay - enroll for free)

### Installing R
First download and install R (the most recent available - currently version 4.1.0) from the CRAN. **[https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)**
You are recommended to use a page in your own country, so please use the following when based in the United Kingdom/ London. **[https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/)**

Make sure you select the correct version for Windows computers, Mac computer or linux computer. 

**For Mac computers**, select mac from **[https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/)**. Then click and install R-4.1.0.pkg. Then scroll towards the bottom of the page and also install tools (under subdirectories heading).

**For windows computers**, select windows from **[https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/)**. Then look at end of line which has **base** on left. Click on install R for the first time (from end of this line). Then click on **Download R 4.1.0 for windows**. Also go back to initial window page, scroll down further and click on and install **RTools**.

### Installing RStudio
R Studio is an integrated development environment for R. You can download the Open Source R Studio Desktop from this link: **[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**. Please choose the free version.

### Now we recommend that you take sections 1 and 2 of the following course (about 2 hours)
Excellent free introduction to R for complete beginners, including installing R/ RStudio: Sections 1 and 2 start from the very beginning, guiding you around the interface. You are recommended (no need to pay - that is only required when you need a certificate). (section 3 is beyond what you are expected to learn on our MPH).
**[Free R Tutorial - R Basics - R Programming Language Introduction](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)**

**For the above course, please make sure you engage with section 1, steps 1-3 and then section 2, step 14, just to check that R is installed properly**


## Preparation for your Statistics course<a name="stats_list"></a>

We teach Statistics at a fast pace. If you have no prior knowledge of Statistics, or if your stats is a bit rusty, you can make things easier on yourself by engaging with some course material before you start. 

**We suggest that you engage with ONE of the following items (listed as 1 to 7) if you do not know/ remember p-values and confidence intervals**

1. Simple video explanations of core concepts in Statistics: Dr Nic’s Maths and Stats: Free. **Highly recommended**
**[Dr Nic's Stats videos](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=dr+nic+stats+youtube&qpvt=dr+nic+stats+youtube&FORM=VDRE)**

2. For starting from the basics, Khan Academy also has excellent tutorials. Free, with the option of giving a donation:
**[Statistics and Probability: Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)**

3. Youtube channel with stats instructional videos:
**[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)**

5. Good online statistics book: The Little Handbook of Statistical Practice by Gerard Dallal. You might engage with the basics at the start and the sections on confidence intervals and significance tests (and possibly even linear regression - some of the book goes beyond your G/MPH Statistics module): http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/LHSP.HTM (accessed 1 Aug 2021).https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00847SM6A

6. A great way to learn R and Statistics simultaneously. This course covers the whole of your MPH Statistics module fairly comprehensively, so you could optionally engage with the start of it:
**[Biostatistics in Public Health: Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/biostatistics-public-health)**

7. This course teaches statistics as applied in R. Your G/MPH Statistics module covers exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, statistical hypothesis testing and linear regression (plus logistic and Cox regression). Please IGNORE Bayesian modules, which are not useful for your MPH qualification.
**[Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)**


### Statistics recommended reading list for term 1 (available from Imperial College library once you start your studies)

- **Essential Medical Statistics.** Kirkwood B and Sterne J (2003) (2nd ed). Blackwell Science Ltd. [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Medical-Statistics-Essentials-Kirkwood/dp/0865428719](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Medical-Statistics-Essentials-Kirkwood/dp/0865428719) 
Chapters 2–5 will support what you learn in the term 1 statistics module.

- **An Introduction to Medical Statistics.** Bland M (2015) (4th ed). Oxford University Press. An alternative excellent standard text book. This includes multiple choice and other questions at the end of chapters, which may be useful for revision purposes. [http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/intro/introcon.htm](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/intro/introcon.htm) contains useful additional material.

### Statistics online resources reading list for term 1

- There is an on-line statistics book developed by David Lane at Rice University, Houston: http://onlinestatbook.com/2/index.html (accessed 1 Aug 2021). Chapters I-XI and XIV are all relevant to this module (but note that this book does not cover regression). The site also contains various applets to demonstrate different statistical concepts, and self-test questions at the end of each chapter.

-	The British Medical Journal has a series of articles called Statistics at Square One, which are designed to introduce basic statistical concepts to a medical audience. These can be accessed on-line from
http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/readers/statistics-at-square-one/statistics-at-square-one (accessed 1 Aug 2021).

-	There is another series of articles called Statistics Notes, also in the BMJ, which cover pretty much everything you might ever want to know (or not know) about medical statistics! See Martin Bland’s web page for a full list of articles and web links: http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/pubs/pbstnote.htm (accessed 1 Aug 2021). Many of the topics covered in this series are beyond the scope of this module, but the following are particularly relevant:

## Learning to code data analysis in R <a name="prep_time"></a>

As with everything else, you will be trained in R coding during your Statistics module(s), and we do not assume or require any prior experience. However, it can take time to get used to programming using R. You are required to use R to tabulate, graph and analyse data during your G/MPH course. If you are keen, you might like to learn a little R before the official start of the G/MPH course. 

There are numerous free or cheap resources online for getting started. Here are a selection of the best:

Thorough guide to using R for statistics. This covers around two thirds of what we teach during your MPH, and several things that we don’t teach. We teach you t-tests, chi-squared test, linear regression and multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance (which is another name for linear regression with categorical predictor variables). (NOT COVERED: we additionally teach logistic regression and Cox regression / survival analysis)
**[R for statistics](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf)**

A great way to learn R and Statistics simultaneously. This course covers the whole of your MPH Statistics module fairly comprehensively:
**[Biostatistics in Public Health: Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/biostatistics-public-health)**

Alternative free introduction to R for complete beginners, including installing R/ RStudio: Focus on what is useful to you on our MPH statistics module, especially Linear regression. You can produce high quality graphs in R using ggplot, which is useful for anyone using R for their dissertation (but not essential learning for MPH students). Graphs are a fun way to practice R coding. IGNORE machine learning elements. Free to take the course – you only have to pay if you want the certificate.

## Epidemiology term 1 reading list <a name="epi_advice"></a>

The pace and content of your Epidemiology module is reasonable pace, and preparation prior to the course is not necessary. Nevertheless, we present your term 1 reading list. There is one free resource that you might choose to dip into. However, we suggest that you prioritise preparing for your Statistics module.
