## Value of preparation prior to your MPH <a name="general_advice"></a>

The term 1 modules will give you a solid foundation in epidemiology and statistics. They also teach key principles in research methods and of public health practice. One of the strengths of our MPH is the strength of our Statistics module. This is also a challenge for our students, since it is especially fast-paced. You are required to learn two separate skill sets – Statistics and coding in R (using R to tabulate, graph and statistically analyse data).  Our students have a diverse range of backgrounds, and there will always be some students with very little experience of each particular subject. So don’t panic if you haven’t, for example, studied epidemiology before. The modules start with the basics and, if you work hard, you will be on a steep learning curve and will reach a high level of understanding by the end of term 1.

With that said, you have the opportunity to lower the gradient of your learning curve by doing some preparatory study ahead of the course in areas that you are less familiar with. This page aims to give you some pointers on how to spend that pre-course preparation time.

## Learning to code data analysis in R <a name="prep_time"></a>

As with everything else, you will be trained in R coding during your Statistics module(s) , and we do not assume or require any prior experience. However, it can initially take a long time to solve simple problems using R, so you can make things easier on yourself by starting this process before the course. You are required to use R to tabulate, graph and analyse data, and these skills take some time to develop. Skills in coding and in statistics are useful in opening up job opportunities for you.

There are numerous free or cheap resources online for getting started. Here are a selection of the best:

Excellent free introduction to R for complete beginners, including installing R/ RStudio: Sections 1 and 2 start from the very beginning, including installing R/ RStudio and guiding you around the interface. (no need to pay - that is only required when you need a certificate). (section 3 is beyond what you are expected to learn on our MPH).
**[Free R Tutorial - R Basics - R Programming Language Introduction](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)**

Thorough guide to using R for statistics. This covers around two thirds of what we teach during your MPH, and several things that we don’t teach. We teach you t-tests, chi-squared test, linear regression and multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance (which is another name for linear regression with categorical predictor variables). (NOT COVERED: we additionally teach logistic regression and Cox regression / survival analysis)
**[R for statistics](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf)**

A great way to learn R and Statistics simultaneously. This course covers the whole of your MPH Statistics module fairly comprehensively:
**[Biostatistics in Public Health: Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/biostatistics-public-health)**

Alternative free introduction to R for complete beginners, including installing R/ RStudio: Focus on what is useful to you on our MPH statistics module, especially Linear regression. You can produce high quality graphs in R using ggplot, which is useful for anyone using R for their dissertation (but not essential learning for MPH students). Graphs are a fun way to practice R coding. Free to take the course – you only have to pay if you want the certificate.
**[Free R Tutorial - R, ggplot, and Simple Linear Regression](https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1/)**


## Computer set-up <a name="cpu_setup"></a>

We will have a dedicated session in the induction week where we will guide you through installing all the required software and packages. However, if you want to do this in advance of starting the course, here 's what you need to do.

You will be extensively using R throughout the year, a widely used programming language for statistical analyses and machine learning (see [https://www.r-project.org/about.html](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)). In this session, we are going to install R, R Studio, and the main R packages that you will be using throughout the year on your laptops.

### Installing R

First download and install R (the most recent available - currently version 4.1.0) from the CRAN.

**[R for Mac OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)**

For Mac users

**[Download R-4.1.0 for Windows. The R-project for statistical computing.](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)**

For Windows users

**[The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org)**

For Linux users

### Installing RStudio

R Studio is an integrated development environment for R. You can download the Open Source R Studio Desktop from this link:

**[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**


### Statistics

While the term 1 statistics course starts with the basics, the whole HDA course is based around a solid understanding of statistics and many concepts can take time to digest. So, if your stats is a bit rusty, you can make things easier on yourself by brushing ahead of the course. When you get to the machine learning module, an understanding of linear algebra will be a great asset. The course does provide optional maths refreshers in term one, which cover linear algebra, but if you haven't studied it before then some pre-course revision may well be beneficial.

Here are some useful stats and linear algebra resources:

**[Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)**

Kill two birds with one stone – this course teaches statistics as applied in R

**[Biostatistics in Public Health: Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/biostatistics-public-health)**

A more epi/biostats focus, but still useful

**[Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning)**

This course provides a thorough grounding in linear algebra for ML

**[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)**

Great youtube channel with stats/ML instructional videos

**[StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer)**

Another great statistics youtube channel

**[Statistics and Probability: Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)**

For starting from the basics, Khan Academy has excellent tutorials

### Statistics recommended reading (books are available from Imperial College library once you being your studies)

Chapters 2–5 will support what you learn in the term 1 statistics module.
- **An Introduction to Medical Statistics.** Bland M (2015) (4th ed). Oxford University Press. An alternative excellent standard text book. This includes multiple choice and other questions at the end of chapters, which may be useful for revision purposes.

Chapters 4–7 will support what you learn in the term 1 statistics module.

## Top Tips and advice for MPH course <a name="toptips"></a>

- Previous students often engaged with preparation material. They find that headstart is incredibly worthwhile.
- Be proactive, ask question and use the resources that are made available to you (resources, fellow students and lecturers)
- Keep your lectures notes and your R code organised, I kept referring back to past tutorials in the project, and having a filing system from the beginning of the project made this so much quicker.
- Don’t think you’re the only one who doesn’t understand something. There’s a huge range of pre-existing skills and knowledge in the other people in the class and inevitably you’ll know less about some stuff and more about other stuff than your pals.
- Especially with the wide range of skill sets in the program, I had to fight my self consciousness to ask questions. Whenever I didn’t get something, other students did not understand either. When I asked simple questions, many classmates were grateful. I would have asked a few more questions had I not been worried about looking like an idiot. Lecturers appreciate receiving questions.
- Get to know the people on the course and work with them – everyone has different strengths and will pick things up at different rates and it really helped this year working together to understand things.
- Capitalise on your classmates’ knowledge! It’s a nice symbiotic relationship.
