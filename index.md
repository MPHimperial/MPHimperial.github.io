# Essential Preparation Prior to your G/MPH Course. 

So you may engage effectively with our fast paced statistics module from day one, we ask you to install R onto your computer before your G/MPH course starts. Current students ask us to emphasise the value of further preparation for your statistics module, since we cater for students with a range of levels of prior knowledge and experiences. We teach from the absolute basics, but at a fast pace. If you have not studied statistics before, or are rusty, some preparation is of great value in helping you thrive, and make the most of this fast-paced course.

## General Advice <a name="general_advice"></a>

Your core Statistics module/ specialisation aims to give you a solid foundation in statistics and in coding with R (term 1 for MPH students and term 2 for GMPH). One of the strengths of our G/MPH is the scope of our Statistics module, where you learn Statistics and analysis with R software. This is also a challenge, since it is fast-paced. Our students have a diverse range of backgrounds, with Statistics and software coding experience. This module starts with the basics and aims to cater for all levels of experiences; still to avoid stress from the very fast pace, some preparation is strongly recommended.

Before you come, **we ask you to install R/ Rstudio onto your computers**, and check that this is working correctly. 

## Essential: Setting up your computer for R <a name="cpu_setup"></a>

You are required to **install R and R studio** before you start your G/MPH. Here's what you need to do. You will use R for your Statistics module, and (according to topic chosen) for your dissertation. Here is R's web page: [https://www.r-project.org/about.html](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)).

**Instructions for installing R and R studio. 
[Video instructions are here: Free R Tutorial - R Basics - R Programming Language Introduction](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)** (no need to pay - enroll for free)

### Installing R
Download and install R (the most recent available - currently version 4.4.1) from the CRAN. **[https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)**
You are recommended to use a page in your own country, so please use the following when based in the United Kingdom/ London. **[https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/)**
If you have issues with the Imperial link and are based in the UK, use any of the other options provided. 

**For Mac computers**, select mac from **[https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/)**. Then click and install R-4.2.1.pkg. Then scroll towards the bottom of the page and also install tools (under subdirectories heading).

**For windows computers**, select windows from **[https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/)**. Then look at end of line which has **base** on left. Click on install R for the first time (from end of this line). Then click on **Download R 4.2.1 for windows**. Also go back to initial window page, scroll down further and click on and install **RTools**.

### Installing RStudio
R Studio is an integrated development environment for R. You can download the Open Source R Studio Desktop from this link: **[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**. Please choose the free version.

### To check that R/ RStudio are correctly installed, take the following course section 1 (steps 1-3) and section 2 (step 14).  
**[Free R Tutorial - R Basics - R Programming Language Introduction](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)** (free - since you don't need a certificate)

## Recommended Preparation for your Statistics course<a name="stats_list"></a>

If you have no prior knowledge of Statistics, or if your stats is a bit rusty, currently students urge you to make things easier on yourself by engaging with some course material before you start. If you are not familiar with or don't recall what p-values and confidence intervals are, please review the following resources to familiarise yourselves.

**You might choose to engage with ONE of the following items (listed as 1 to 6)**

### To check that R/ RStudio are correctly installed, take the following course, section 1 (steps 1-3) and section 2 (step 14).  
Excellent free introduction to R for complete beginners, including installing R/ RStudio: Sections 1 and 2 start from the very beginning, guiding you around the interface. (free - payment is for a certificate that you don't need). (section 3 is beyond what is needed).
**[Free R Tutorial - R Basics - R Programming Language Introduction](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)**


1. Learn R and Statistics simultaneously, this course covers much of your MPH Statistics module in outline, but you are required to engage with some more complex material. You might want to study half of this course: **[Biostatistics in Public Health: Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/biostatistics-public-health)**

2. Learn R and statistics simultaneously. Please take exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, statistical hypothesis testing and linear regression modules (Bayesian modules are not relevant). **[Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)

3. Simple video explanations of core concepts in Statistics: Dr Nic’s Maths and Stats: Free. Highly recommended: **[Dr Nic's Stats videos](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=dr+nic+stats+youtube&qpvt=dr+nic+stats+youtube&FORM=VDRE)**

4. For starting from the basics, Khan Academy also has excellent tutorials. Free, donations accepted: **[Statistics and Probability: Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)**

5. Good online statistics book: The Little Handbook of Statistical Practice by Gerard Dallal. Engage with the basics and sections on confidence intervals, significance tests and linear regression (then this book diverges from your G/MPH needs): http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/LHSP.HTM .https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00847SM6A

6. Good intuitive explanations of basic statistical concepts that will be covered in this module, plus lots of interactive learning tools http://www.seeingstatistics.com/ .

7. If you want to buy a printed book to cover your statistics module, with little maths: **Essential Medical Statistics.** Kirkwood B and Sterne J (2003) (2nd ed). Blackwell Science Ltd. [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Medical-Statistics-Essentials-Kirkwood/dp/0865428719](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Medical-Statistics-Essentials-Kirkwood/dp/0865428719). Chapters 2–5 will support what you learn in the term 1 statistics module. (available from Imperial College library once you start your studies)

8. If you want to buy a printed book to cover your statistics module that provides slightly more formulas: **An Introduction to Medical Statistics.** Bland M (2015) (4th ed). Oxford University Press. An alternative excellent standard text book, please review chapters 4-7. This includes multiple choice and other questions at the end of chapters, useful for revision. [http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/intro/introcon.htm](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/intro/introcon.htm) contains useful additional material. (available from Imperial College library once you start your studies)

9. Thorough guide to using R for statistics. You can learn t-tests, chi-squared test, linear regression and multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance (which is another name for linear regression with categorical predictor variables) as a start for your G/MPH module.
**[R for statistics](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf)**

10. Videos explaining basic concepts, plus a few comedy videos. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzFWQHuAzQiFtAl5cNKCqQA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzFWQHuAzQiFtAl5cNKCqQA).
